Rest in peace, Kori.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2024 07:11:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Thinking of Mr. McCloud’s family today as they lay this grea</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php</link><description>Thinking of Mr. McCloud’s family today as they lay this great man to rest.
