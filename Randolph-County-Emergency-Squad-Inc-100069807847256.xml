Mental health is not a joke and needs to be made known that it’s ok to not feel ok.  It’s ok to get help or talk to someone.  Most of the time there isn’t any signs, because the person doesn’t want anyone to know.  We hope Kori found the peace she needed.  Rest in peace, Kori.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2024 07:11:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
