Our calendar company is calling again for ad spots for the new 2025 Sheriff’s Office calendars. This is not a spam call or a scam. If you are interested in a calendar spot on the new calendars please take the time to talk with these folks. This is an approved vendor by the sheriff’s office. Any money raised by this ad will be used for Hooked on Fishing Not on Drugs event next spring. Thank you Rob Elbon</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2024 18:06:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>School starts in Randolph County tomorrow morning August 19t</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/RCSOWV/posts/521564060267066</link><description>School starts in Randolph County tomorrow morning August 19th 2024. Please be vigilant and slow down for all school zones. If yellow or red lights are flashing on a bus DO NOT pass it. Deputies will be out in school zones out in the county. We will write citations for school zone and bus pass infractions. Watch for our kids and be safe.
