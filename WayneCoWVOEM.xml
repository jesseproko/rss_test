Some PM storms will be possible both days, with best chances in the mountains.
Some widespread showers and storms are expected Saturday. Some of them could contain very heavy rain and cause localized water issues, especially in urbanized areas, and a few may also contain strong winds. A few storms linger Sunday, then MUCH more comfortable just in time for Labor Day!</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Aug 2024 06:19:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Aug 29, 2024: Heat and humidity finish out the week with the</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/WayneCoWVOEM/posts/pfbid027funVi1Y6fwggDfu87Xu1bfFKCWD9PAxv9oDFn2zQi5ejKyREBY1Q5sTjpfDmxhhl</link><description>Aug 29, 2024: Heat and humidity finish out the week with the heat index reaching over 100ยบ across the lowlands today and Friday.
