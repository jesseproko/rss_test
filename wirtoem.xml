As you can see from the map, we are in a pretty severe drought and it would not take much for a brush fire to start.    If you must burn, please have a ring around your fire and a good water source for extinguishment.    Several counties in our area have already experienced brush fires so please do your part and help prevent forest fires.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 08:39:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
