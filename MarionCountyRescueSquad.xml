Training covered methods of rapidly doffing firefighter turnout gear, methods of rapid removal from the fireground, and treating firefighters in cardiac arrest. Additionally, crews discussed logistics and operational matters in the event of a “MAYDAY” or “Urgent Message” on the fireground. MCRS responds to numerous structure fires every year as medical standby and also provides fireground rehabilitation. Being able to respond to such calls involving our fellow first responders is very near and dear to us!</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 22:57:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Photos from Marion County Rescue Squad's post</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/MarionCountyRescueSquad/posts/pfbid0SvofeZ9DKsFvk9DkvSiZtMX4j4u8dEFghMZjD5h4fxAaXxK6v1G2fjwNVaZHf7qnl</link><description>Football has arrived in Marion County!
