You should expect delays in and around the downtown Morgantown area throughout the day. There will be an increase in vehicle traffic and foot traffic on Beechurst Ave., Campus Drive and University Ave., area today between 10am-4pm due to the Pat McAfee show being broadcast live at the life sciences building and Fox sports putting on events at the Mountain Lair. The lower half of River Road between the Westover Bridge and the entrance to the Dog Pound will be closed due to a fireworks display being set up for the last outside concert of the season and River Front park tonight downtown. All of these events combined, along with a sold out opening football game will create traffic delays that should be planned for today. Please be patient or use alternative routes if you have to travel around the downtown area of Morgantown today and tomorrow.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 12:33:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Date Issued: 8/28/24Date Lifted: 8/30/24PWSID# 3303111Morgan</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/MCOEM/posts/pfbid02FP8NpaD38TvPY3d3FrgrvtXpL7Y6Yn79LQjjUumUwefX61CFPLwLqSjsu5MFCtpWl</link><description>Date Issued: 8/28/24Date Lifted: 8/30/24PWSID# 3303111Morgantown Utility Board (MUB) has lifted a precautionary boil water advisory for approximately 41 customers at 101 to 1003 Lakeview Estate Townhomes.Results of the water quality testing have confirmed that the water quality meets drinking water standards.
