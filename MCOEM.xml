Morgantown Utility Board (MUB) has lifted a precautionary boil water advisory for approximately 25 customers at 22-460 Dawson Road and 43 Wiseman Road.
Results of the water quality testing have confirmed that the water quality meets drinking water standards.  Therefore, there is no further need to boil water prior to consumption.  Customers will be notified of the advisory lifting in the same manner as they were for the issuance.
Please reach out to us with any questions or additional information that may be needed.
Thank you.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Aug 2024 05:49:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Date: 8/28/24
