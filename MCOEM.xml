Morgantown Utility Board (MUB) has issued a precautionary boil water advisory for approximately 41 customers at 101 to 1003 Lakeview Estate Townhomes.
Once service is restored, affected customers will be advised to boil their water before consumption until the boil water advisory is lifted.  When the system recovers, MUB will be collecting water quality samples in the area of the outage, which requires a minimum of 24 hours for analysis.  Customers and the appropriate agencies will be notified in the same manner once the analysis is complete and the advisory can be lifted.
In the meantime, please reach out to us with any questions or additional information that may be needed.
Thank you.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 12:59:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Date Issued: 8/26/24
