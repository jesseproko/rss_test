Due to temperatures in Logan County to rise to unsafe levels, these cooling centers are for residents who do not have access to air conditioning. 
During hot weather, residents are reminded to:
Drink plenty of fluids.
Try to stay in the shade or indoors as much as possible.
If working outside, take frequent breaks, preferably in an air-conditioned space.
Check on elderly neighbors and those with functional needs.
